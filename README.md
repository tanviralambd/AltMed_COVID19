# Alternative Medicine in Clinical Trials against COVID19

In this study, we addressed the alternative medications that have been targeted in the clinical trials (CTs) to be evidenced as an adjuvant treatment against COVID-19. Based on the outcomes from CTs, we found that dietary supplements such as Lactoferrin, and Probiotics (as SivoMixx) can play a role enhancing the immunity thus can be used as prophylactics against COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was proven as an effective adjuvant treatment against COVID-19, while Vitamin C role is uncertain and needs more investigation. Herbals such as Guduchi Ghan Vati can be used as prophylactic, while Resveratrol can be used to reduce the hospitalization risk of COVID-19 patients. On the contrary, there were no clinical improvements demonstrated when using Cannabidiol. This study is a part of a two-phase research study. In the first phase, we gathered evidence-based information on alternative therapeutics for COVID-19 that are under CT. In the second phase, we plan to build a mobile health application that will provide evidence based alternative therapy information to health consumers.
